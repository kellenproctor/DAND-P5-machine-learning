# P5: Identify Fraud from Enron Email

## Supporting Materials

**P5-Enron_White_Board.html**: My "worksheet", if you will, with all the intermediate work I did to complete this project. My train of thought flows pretty consistently through the comments, and the work is presented in chronological order, for the most part. Most of my work is here, with only final code copied and cleaned up for placement in poi_id.py.

This is the html export of the UML-Enron_White_Board.ipynb jupyter notebook, which can be run if you need to confirm any of the results or code.

**P5-Question_Responses-final.html**: The final answers to the questions for the project. Also contains references used to complete this project. 

**P5-Question_Responses.html**: First submission
