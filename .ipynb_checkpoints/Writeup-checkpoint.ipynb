    "## 1. Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is simply to identify persons of interest (\"POI\") at Enron, ie those that were likely to have organized, perpetrated, and profited from the ongoing fraudulent activities at the firm. By the way, I watched the documentary, and being from California, what they did was just unconscionable. I have no idea how they were able to get access to the Power Grid, being able to shut off power plants and all, but it's kinda messed up that more people didn't get indicted. Regardless... The dataset has a wealth of financial and email related features. It would be difficult to identify POIs by hand. Instead, we can use machine learning algorithms to try to come up with a way to determine POIs programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "There are 146 datapoints and 18 of those are POIs. The dataset contains 20 different features, split bewteen 14 financial and 6 email related features, for the people we are investigating. There's also a label - \"poi\" - that we can use for identifying persons of interest. Interestingly enough, only the features 'expenses', 'other', 'total_payments', 'total_stock_value', (and with 1 exception) 'restricted_stock', and 'salary' had valid data for all POIs. I may choose to use just these features in feature selection, but I'd like to keep all the features for now, and see what the results of using feature selection algorithms show.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outliers\n",
    "I simply printed out a list of the keys of data_dict. Based on the outliers mini-project, and a couple forum entries, I found \"TOTAL\" and \"THE TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK.\" Both were not POIs, from looking at their data, they either skewed the total data, or had none. So I removed both of these from the dataset. I chose to leave the remaining entries in data_dict, as they represent actual people. Further, the dataset is already very tiny, so I don't want to lose more information if I don't have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running a few scripts to analyze the remaining persons and features, I chose to also remove 'LOCKHARD EUGENE E', who basically had no data.\n"

    "I created fractional features for payments, stock value, and email related features. This was based off of a forum post I read, but I figured it also may make certain features easier to compare between individuals, since some features like salary and bonus won't be so skewed by outlying individuals.\n",

    "After experimenting with various values of k for SelectKBest with a naive bayes classifier, I ended up using the following list of features ('salary', 'bonus_fraction', 'long_term_incentive', 'deferred_income', 'deferral_payments', 'other', 'expenses', 'total_payments', 'exercised_stock_options', 'restricted_stock', 'total_stock_value', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'to_messages', 'from_poi_to_this_person', 'from_messages', 'shared_receipt_with_poi'), which would be trimmed down in an optimized GridSearchCV pipeline, before being fed to the Naive Bayes classifier I ended up using.

    "My reasoning for creating the ratio of individual values to total values was to scale features so that they might be more comparable between individuals. There were a lot of individual features that were skewed in favor of some individuals that had large payments. Further, there was a pretty good mix between POIs and non-POIs with regards to those large features. I wanted to explore if the composition of the individual features to the total was more important that the feature itself. For example, I figured that perhaps POIs had a larger composition of their total payments related to bonus than otherwise, or they had larger percentages of restricted stock values.\n",

    "To determine the value of these new features, I scored the entire feature list (new and existing features), using an ANOVA f classifier with SelectKBest. I found that, aside from bonus_fraction, most of the fractional created features performed poorly. Because of this performance, I chose not to use the fractional features in my final algorithm, with the exception of bonus_fraction, which I used instead of bonus. I chose not to use salary_fraction, because salary performed slightly better, and I didn't want to use two similar features and risk adding collinearity into my model. This is also part of the reason I chose to exclude bonus. The full result of the SelectKBest scoring is listed here in this table.\n",

We are trying to get the algorithm to the sweetspot between high bias and high variance. If our algorithm is too biased to the dataset, then it isn't training well, which results in poor performance. If our algorithm has too much variance, then it we may have overfit the algorithm to the training data. This means it won't generalize well, making it a poor predictor moving forward. Either way, we end up with an algorithm that reacts poorly with real world data outside of our training set. We are trying to get it to a point where the algorithm generalizes well to new data, but isn't too simple. That is the goal of tuning.\n",

However, accuracy just tells us if the prediction matches the actual label in the test dataset. We can further break that number down, and determine how many times we correctly predicted positive and negative values, and how many times our predictions were wrong positively or negatively. Precision tells us then how many times we were correct in predicting someone to be a POI, out of all positive predictions of people being POIs. With a precision rate of 0.40 for NaiveBayes and 0.35 for RandomForest, we were only good at positively identifying a POI at best 40% of the time.  As for Recall, we're trying to figure out how many times we predicted someone being a POI, and they actually were a POI. For recall, our best was .31 with the naive bayes algorithm. These results aren't actually that great. Overall, we're decent at predicting the outcome, but we're not that good at actually predicting the outcome correctly and consistently."
